# Revision-Style Mentorship Template

Built as a template for mentoring

## Brief

Create a product site based on the API provided in `/api-tester`

You may use any external libraries that you've ever used before.

Design is not important, but it should be functional.

2. The list should show the product title, description, and price.

2. Create a button for `Edit` and `Delete`

### Product Edit Page
